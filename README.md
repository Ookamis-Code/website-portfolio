# Engineering Portfolio | Language-Agnostic Systems

This repository serves as the central "Command Center" for my software engineering projects. It is designed to showcase core engineering principles—concurrency, memory management, and system architecture—across a variety of programming languages.

## 🛠 Core Tech Stack
- **Framework:** [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org) (App Router)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- **Deployment:** Containerized via Docker (Planned)

## 🎯 The Philosophy
As a self-taught hobbyist moving into professional engineering, I prioritize **patterns over syntax**. This site dynamically pulls data from my various projects, whether they are built in C++, Rust, Python, or Go, to demonstrate a versatile problem-solving mindset.

## 🚀 Setup & Development
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`
