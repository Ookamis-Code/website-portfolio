# Engineering Portfolio | Language-Agnostic Systems

A high-performance portfolio built to demonstrate that core engineering principles—state management, API integration, and system architecture—transcend specific syntax.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Interactive Terminal:** A custom-built command-line interface (built with React state) allowing users to query project data.
- **Dynamic Project Engine:** Integrated with the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com) to fetch live repository statistics and status.
- **Strictly Typed:** Built entirely in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for enterprise-grade reliability.
- **Live Data Integration:** Automatically syncs repository statistics (stars, last updated) via the GitHub REST API.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Fully automated Docker builds using GitHub Actions with secure secret management.


## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Core:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **State/Logic:** React Hooks + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-first design)
- **Icons:** Lucide-React

## 💻 Commands
In the integrated terminal, you can run:
- `ls`: List all projects and their primary languages.
- `about`: View the engineering philosophy.
- `help`: See all available system commands.
